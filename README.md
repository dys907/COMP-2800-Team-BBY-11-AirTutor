## General Info
Air Tutor is a web application for students who are not doing well with their classes in remote learning. In Air Tutor, students can request help with their homework and tutors can message these students, eventually scheduling a session where both tutors and students can use voice call and canvas features so that the tutor can better teach the material and the student can better understand it. 

The features of this project include:
* A submission feature utilized by students so they can request help for homework
* A messaging feature utilized by tutors so they can communicate their ability to help with their homework
* A scheduling feature utilized by students so they can schedule sessions with a tutor
* A voice call feature utilized by both students and tutors so that tutors can better teach the material and the student can better understand the material
* A canvas feature utilized by both students and tutors so tutors can visually communicate the material and students can show the thought process of their learning
* A live chat feature utilized by both students and tutors where students can ask quick questions about their homework and tutors can respond in real time
* A rating feature utilized by students where they can rate their tutor after a session; this rating will then be displayed in the tutorâ€™s profile page to highlight their credibility
